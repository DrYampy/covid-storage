#covid-storage
A Repo built around an article series on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@syampols) site, called [Data Pipeline on a Shoestring](https://medium.com/@syampols/data-pipeline-on-a-shoestring-part-i-where-to-begin-a085bb397470) 

Uses a CircleCI pipeline to deploy a GCS bucket to store Covid data as part of the article series.

Requires a CircleCI account linked to the repository.
